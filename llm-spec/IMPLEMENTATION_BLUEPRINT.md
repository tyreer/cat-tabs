# Tabs Component Implementation Blueprint

## Overview

This blueprint provides a step-by-step implementation plan for building the Tabs component according to the specification. Each step is designed to be small, testable, and builds incrementally on previous work.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implement
- **Incremental Progress**: Each step builds on the previous
- **Early Integration**: Wire components together at each step
- **No Orphaned Code**: Every piece integrates with existing work
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA attributes from the start

### Step Sizing Criteria

- **Small enough**: Can be implemented and tested in 15-30 minutes
- **Big enough**: Moves the project forward meaningfully
- **Testable**: Each step has clear success criteria
- **Integrated**: No hanging or orphaned code

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3)

Build the basic structure and types

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Steps 4-6)

Implement basic tab switching and state management

### Phase 3: Accessibility (Steps 7-9)

Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Phase 4: Styling (Steps 10-12)

Implement old-school Windows interface

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Steps 13-15)

Comprehensive testing and final integration

## Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Project Setup and Type Definitions

```text
Create the basic project structure for the Tabs component:

1. Create `src/components/Tabs.tsx` with a basic functional component structure
2. Define TypeScript interfaces:
   - `TabObject` with `id: string`, `label: string`, `content: ReactNode`
   - `TabsProps` with `tabs: TabObject[]`, `activeTabId?: string`, `onTabChange?: (activeTab: TabObject) => void`, `'aria-label'?: string`
3. Set up basic component export with proper TypeScript typing
4. Create `src/components/index.ts` to export the Tabs component
5. Ensure the component compiles without errors

The component should be a basic functional component that accepts the props but doesn't render anything yet. Focus on getting the TypeScript interfaces correct and the basic structure in place.
```

### Prompt 2: Basic Component Structure with ARIA Attributes

```text
Build the basic component structure with proper ARIA roles:

1. Create the main `Tabs` component that destructures the props
2. Create three sub-components in the same file:
   - `TabList` with `role="tablist"`
   - `Tab` with `role="tab"`
   - `TabPanel` with `role="tabpanel"`
3. Set up basic JSX structure that renders:
   - A tablist containing all tabs
   - Each tab with proper ARIA attributes
   - Each tabpanel with proper ARIA attributes
4. Add basic props passing between components
5. Ensure all ARIA roles are present and correct

The component should render the basic structure with all tabs visible and all ARIA attributes in place. Don't worry about functionality yet - just the structure and accessibility foundation.
```

### Prompt 3: Basic State Management and Tab Switching

```text
Implement basic tab switching functionality:

1. Add `useState` for active tab state (default to first tab)
2. Implement click handlers for tab switching
3. Add active tab highlighting (basic visual distinction)
4. Implement content panel switching (show/hide based on active tab)
5. Add basic controlled/uncontrolled support:
   - If `activeTabId` prop is provided, use it (controlled)
   - Otherwise, use internal state (uncontrolled)
6. Call `onTabChange` callback when tabs change

The component should now be fully functional for basic tab switching. Users should be able to click tabs to switch between them, see the active tab highlighted, and see the content change. Test that both controlled and uncontrolled modes work.
```

### Prompt 4: Keyboard Navigation (Arrow Keys)

```text
Add arrow key navigation for tabs:

1. Add `useCallback` for keyboard event handlers
2. Implement Left/Right arrow key handling:
   - Left arrow: move to previous tab (wrap to last if at first)
   - Right arrow: move to next tab (wrap to first if at last)
3. Add focus management between tabs
4. Ensure focus indicators are visible
5. Integrate keyboard navigation with existing click navigation

The component should now support full keyboard navigation. Users should be able to use arrow keys to navigate between tabs, with focus wrapping around correctly. The keyboard navigation should work seamlessly with the existing click navigation.
```

### Prompt 5: Automatic Activation and Focus Management

```text
Implement automatic tab activation on focus:

1. Add focus event handlers for tabs
2. Implement automatic activation logic (tabs activate when focused)
3. Add proper focus management for the tablist
4. Implement Tab key handling to exit the tablist
5. Integrate automatic activation with keyboard navigation
6. Ensure focus moves correctly with arrow keys

The component should now have full keyboard accessibility. Users should be able to navigate with arrow keys, and tabs should activate automatically when focused. The Tab key should properly exit the tablist, and focus management should be smooth and intuitive.
```

### Prompt 6: Error Handling and Validation

```text
Add validation and error handling for edge cases:

1. Add tab object validation on mount:
   - Check for required properties (id, label, content)
   - Validate that all tabs have unique IDs
2. Add error message display for invalid tabs
3. Handle empty tabs array with appropriate message
4. Handle missing required properties with specific error messages
5. Display inline error messages within the component
6. Ensure validation doesn't break existing functionality

The component should now handle edge cases gracefully. Invalid tabs should show clear error messages, empty arrays should show appropriate messages, and the component should remain functional even with invalid data.
```

### Prompt 7: ARIA Attributes and Accessibility

```text
Implement full ARIA compliance:

1. Add `aria-selected="true/false"` on tabs based on active state
2. Add `aria-controls` linking each tab to its corresponding panel
3. Add `aria-labelledby` linking each panel to its corresponding tab
4. Support `aria-label` prop for the tablist
5. Ensure proper focus management for screen readers
6. Add any additional ARIA attributes needed for full compliance

The component should now be fully accessible. Screen readers should be able to navigate the tabs properly, all ARIA relationships should be correct, and the component should meet W3C accessibility guidelines.
```

### Prompt 8: Basic Styling Structure

```text
Set up styled-components structure:

1. Create styled-components for each element:

3. Set up color scheme (grays with blue accents)
4. Add typography setup (system fonts, pixelated appearance)
5. Implement spacing system using gap/padding (no margins)

The component should now have a basic visual structure. The styling should be in place with proper layout, colors, and typography, following the no-margin principle for spacing.
```

### Prompt 9: Old-School Windows Interface Styling

   - Proper shadows and highlights
2. Implement active/inactive tab states with distinct visual differences
3. Apply gray color scheme with blue accents (retro Windows colors)
4. Add pixelated typography appearance
5. Implement retro button interactions (hover, focus, active states)

The component should now look like an old Windows interface. Tabs should have the classic 3D beveled appearance, active/inactive states should be clearly distinct, and the overall aesthetic should match the retro Windows look.
```

### Prompt 10: Performance Optimizations
