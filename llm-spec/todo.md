---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Step 1: Project Structure & Type Definitions

- [x] Create `src/components/Tabs.tsx` with basic functional component structure
- [x] Define `TabObject` interface with `id: string`, `label: string`, `content: ReactNode`
- [x] Define `TabsProps` interface with all required props
- [x] Set up basic component export with proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Create/update `src/components/index.ts` to export Tabs component
- [x] Verify TypeScript compilation without errors
- [x] Ensure component structure exists and exports work

### Step 2: Basic Component Structure with ARIA

- [x] Create main `Tabs` component with props destructuring
- [x] Create `TabList` sub-component with `role="tablist"`
- [x] Create `Tab` sub-component with `role="tab"`
- [x] Create `TabPanel` sub-component with `role="tabpanel"`
- [x] Set up basic JSX structure rendering all tabs
- [x] Add proper ARIA attributes to all elements
- [x] Ensure all ARIA roles are present and correct
- [x] Test that component renders without errors
- [x] Test that all tabs are rendered
- [x] Test that ARIA roles are present

### Step 3: Basic State Management & Tab Switching

- [x] Add `useState` for active tab state (default to first tab)
- [x] Implement click handlers for tab switching
- [x] Add active tab highlighting (basic visual distinction)
- [x] Implement content panel switching (show/hide based on active tab)
- [x] Add controlled/uncontrolled support:
  - [x] If `activeTabId` prop provided, use it (controlled)
  - [x] Otherwise, use internal state (uncontrolled)
- [x] Call `onTabChange` callback when tabs change
- [x] Test tab switching on click
- [x] Test active tab highlighting
- [x] Test content changes
- [x] Test default active tab
- [x] Test controlled vs uncontrolled modes
